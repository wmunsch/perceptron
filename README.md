# perceptron

This is a simple perceptron built in c++ by William Munsch.

The Iris dataset is included in main.cpp to train and test the perceptron.

PerceptronExample.exe is the compiled executable which allows the user to
enter iris flower measurements which will be classified by the perceptron.
